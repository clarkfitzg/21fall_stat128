Announcements:

- Overview of assignments coming up
- Done with R programming, moving on to data visualization
- Data science career panel

- Midterm possibly on Tuesday Oct 19th.
- Weights: midterm 10%, project is 30%

123 GO: How are you feeling about the "full SIR simulation" due tomorrow?

123 GO:
Would it be helpful to have another office hour on Monday or Friday?

Yes- I will schedule based on Math 99 students (extra unit)


Mid semester check in

## How you're doing

- Busy, balancing school and work


## Good things

- Lecture notes outline with live coding
- 123 GO's have been helpful, even when watching recording.


## Future course assignment progression

- Include short feedback loops so that you can build on correct code.
- Give hints on which functions are useful for task.

1. Auto graded Canvas quizzes covering terminolology

        "which of the following is a function call?"
    
2. Narrow, specific tasks

        "make a 10 x 15 matrix filled in with 25% 1's and the remainder 0's in random places."

3. Define functions by filling in a skeleton with parameters, return types.
```
        initial_infect = function(num_rows, num_cols, p0 = 0.1){
            # TODO: Return matrix containing p0 proportion of 1's, remainder 0's
        }
```
4. Define functions based on higher level instructions.

        "write a function to do the initial infection"


## Will do this semester

- Repeat questions / comments from in person class
- More realistic application examples


## Will do in future semester

- In person lab section


## Not going to change

- faster / slower pace
- More people in physical class

                                                                |population==0 & y3==1
                                                                |population==0 & y4==1
                                                                |population==0 & y5==1
                                                                |population==0 & y6==1
                                                                |population==0 & y7==1
                                                                |population==0 & y8==1,
                                                                1,0)))


y1 = matrix(c(1, 0, 0))
y2 = matrix(c(1, 1, 0))
y3 = matrix(c(1, 1, 1))
y1 + y2 + y3
```
