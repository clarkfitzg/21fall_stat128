Three popular systems for creating visualizations in R:

The base R functions
The lattice package
The ggplot2 package



```{r}

```



```{r}
earn = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-02-23/earn.csv")
```

Letâ€™s make a line plot that shows median earnings for each quarter in 2019, with separate lines for men and women.

```{r}

```

The tidyverse way:

```{r}

```




## Layer 1 - data


```{r}
library(ggplot2)

```

An example that came up for a student in the last project:

```{r}
infections = read.csv("infections.csv", row.names = 1)

```



## Layer 2 - geometry

```{r}
```


## Layer 3 - aesthetics

```{r}
```


```{r}
```

## Layer 4 - scales

```{r}

```

## Annotations

```{r}
```



## Saving

```{r}
ggsave("line.png")
```

Plot devices

```{r}
```
