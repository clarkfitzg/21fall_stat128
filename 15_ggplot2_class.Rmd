Three popular systems for creating visualizations in R:

The base R functions - we've used this.
The lattice package - skipping for now
The ggplot2 package - very popular, worth learning

base R uses a "painter's canvas" model.

123 GO: will the big red line "paint over" the points?
yes

```{r}
x = rnorm(100)
plot(x)
abline(h = 0, lwd = 10, col = "red")  # < a big red line

```



```{r}
earn = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-02-23/earn.csv")
```

Letâ€™s make a line plot that shows median earnings for each quarter in 2019, with separate lines for men and women.

Start with the right data.
```{r}
# 1
earn19 = earn[earn$year == 2019, ]
earn19 = earn19[earn19$race == "All Races", ]
earn19 = earn19[earn19$ethnic_origin == "All Origins", ]
earn19 = earn19[earn19$age == "16 years and over", ]
```

```{r}
# 2 with
earn19b = earn[with(earn, year == 2019 &
  race == "All Races" &
  ethnic_origin == "All Origins" &
  age == "16 years and over"), ]
```

The tidyverse way:
```{r}
# 3 dplyr filter
library(tidyverse)
earn19c = earn %>% filter(
  year == 2019, 
  race == "All Races",
  ethnic_origin == "All Origins",
  age == "16 years and over")
```

ggplot2

gg is for "grammar of graphics" - a declarative model of how you want the visualization to look.
Build up the vis in layers.

every plot in ggplot2 must have:
- data
- geometry
- aesthetics



## Layer 1 - data

ggplot (and everything else in the tidyverse) requires "tidy data".

Tidy means a data frame:

1. Each observation has exactly one row
2. Each feature is a column
3. Each value is in exactly one cell

Tidy data is "3rd normal form" in Codd's relational data theory.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

earn19
```

An example that came up for a student in the last project:

```{r}
infections = read.csv("infections.csv", row.names = 1)

boxplot(infections$Circle.results)
```
Fixing this data format

1. Each observation has exactly one row
2. Each feature is a column
3. Each value is in exactly one cell

123  go
more rows or less rows?

WANT:

shape   | count
-----   | -----
circle  | 129
rectangle  | 84
line  | 234
normal  | 212
circle  | 240
...

```{r}
# need to pivot this table
inf2 = pivot_longer(infections, cols = everything(),
                    names_to = "shape",
                    values_to = "count")

ggplot(data = inf2, aes(x = shape, y = count)) + geom_boxplot()

# Won't work
#ggplot(data = infections, aes(x = shape, y = count)) + geom_boxplot()
```

tbl, data frame, table, are mostly interchangable

## Layer 2 - geometry

```{r}
ggplot(earn19) + geom_line()
```


## Layer 3 - aesthetics

123 go: for a line plot, is it OK for x to be repeated?

```{r}
ggplot(earn19, aes(x = quarter, y = median_weekly_earn, linetype = sex)) + geom_line()

# What if I wanted color to vary by sex, instead of linetype?
ggplot(earn19, aes(x = quarter, y = median_weekly_earn, color = sex)) + geom_line()
```

Suppose I want everything blue.

```{r}
ggplot(earn19, aes(x = quarter, y = median_weekly_earn, linetype = sex)) + geom_line(color = "blue")
```


## Layer 4 - scales

```{r}
ggplot(earn19, aes(x = quarter, y = median_weekly_earn, linetype = sex)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  labs(y = "median weekly earnings ($USD)", title = "Earnings by sex", 
       caption = "Data from Nick Ulle's R Basics")
```

## Annotations

```{r}
p = ggplot(earn19, aes(x = quarter, y = median_weekly_earn, linetype = sex)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  labs(y = "median weekly earnings ($USD)", title = "Earnings by sex", 
       caption = "Data from Nick Ulle's R Basics")

p = p + annotate("text", label = "elbow", x = 3, y = 1000, vjust = "top")
p
```

ggsave("line.png")
```
