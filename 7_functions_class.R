# Announcements:
#
# 1. - Correction- SIR model is a Markov Chain, but is not MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo)
# "A Markov chain or Markov process is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event." -Wikipedia

# 2. Project posted as many small, regular assignments.
#   Alternatively, just do the whole thing right now.
#   I'll probably talk about it more in office hours (remind me to record)

# 3. Discord is in, MS Teams is retired.
#   Talk through the project with each other, and with me.

# 4. Advising, math minor, Stat 128 course substitution form


# Notes: Sections 3.2 and 3.3 of text
# https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_r_basics/exploring-your-data.html#conditional-expressions

# Outcomes:
#
# 1. Write if() statements, and predict results
# 2. Write R functions

# if() represents conditional statements 

# 123 GO: what's a conditional statement from every day life?
# Example:

# else


# Functions are the HEART of R. ‚ù§Ô∏è


# 123 GO:
# Which arguments does append accept?


# Demoing a good process to write a function:
# 1. Write down what you want.
# 2. Check if that functionality already exists.
# 3. Make some experimental data and figure out the code.
# 4. Stick that code in a function

# 123 GO:
# What should I name this function?


# 123 GO:
# Predict these two outcomes

# 123 GO:
# What's one good practice for function naming?

# 123 GO:
# What happens when I pass in string arguments?


# 123 GO
# What should our function DO when we call it with nonnumeric arguments?
# We get to decide, we're the architects ü§†

# 123 GO:
# Did any remaining code in the function run after we hit return()?
