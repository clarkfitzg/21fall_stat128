# Announcements:
#
# 1. Project 2 drafts due tomorrow (Dec 1) for feedback
# 2. Sign up for a presentation slot next week
#
# Outcomes:
#
# 1. Apply the naive bootstrap to create confidence intervals for univariate statistics
#
# Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)

# There are MANY variations of bootstrap and resampling methods.
# Our goal today is just the most basic one.


# Like most statistical methods, the bootstrap relies on IID data.
# What does IID mean?

# The central limit theorem says ...

# Simple bootstrap procedure:

# How can we get a confidence interval for the 1st and 3rd quartiles?

# Why is it called the naive bootstrap?

# bootstrapping residuals (if we have time)
