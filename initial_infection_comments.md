## Common

- Initialization function should accept three arguments, as described in instructions.
- Write two functions: one for plotting, one for random initialization.


## Less Common

- Choose descriptive function names.
- Seed the RNG outside of the function, so that the user has control over the behavior, rather than the function.
- This function doesn't use the inputs; it redefines them.
- Submit code in one of the supported formats so that I can see it.
- Return the SIR matrix.


## Small things

- No need for return().
- Use default argument for proportion infected.
