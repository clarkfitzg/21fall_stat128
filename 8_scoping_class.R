# 123 GO
# Where are you on the initial infection assignment?

# Outcomes:

# 1. Write R scripts
# 2. Predict when variables will be available based on R's lexical scoping rules.

# Review:
# Functions are the building blocks for solving larger problems. Take a divide-and-conquer approach, breaking large problems into smaller steps. Use a short function for each step. This approach makes it easier to:
# 
# Test that each step works correctly.
# Modify, reuse, or repurpose a step.


# Demo R scripting and how to turn in assignment


# 123 GO: What happens if I try to print x before I define it?
x 

# exists() checks if a variable exists.
exists("x")

x = 10

# Variables only exist inside the __scope__ where they were defined.

# Each call to a function create a new __local__ scope.
rescale = function(x, center, scale){
  centered = x - center
  centered / scale

# 123 GO:
# Does `centered` exist?

f = function() {
  z_defined = exists('z')
  z = 42
  z_defined
}

f() # FALSE, meaning z was not defined the FIRST time we called f()

# 123 GO: What will f() return on the 2nd call?
f() # FALSE every single time

# A function can use variables defined outside (non-local), but only if those variables are in scope where the function was defined.

# Variables defined directly in the R console are global and available to any function.

# Does __variable lookup__ happens when a function is called, or when it‚Äôs defined?
# R uses Dynamic variable lookup.
# R looks up the value of all variables with every single function call.

# Uses global variables.

# Should we use global variables inside our functions?

# We have access to 1252 functions just from the base package.

# Summary:
# Each function calls create a new local scope (call frame) where local variables:
# 
# 1. Are private
# 2. Exist only within the context of that call
# 3. Mask non-local variables
